Features:
- General:
	- Tests every frame if the platforms are in view

- Controls
	- Jumps can be queued after the player starts falling with a velocity of 0.0001 (to prevent earlybirds from killing themselves)

- Time:
	- Fully time dependent
	- Using sf::Time::asMicroseconds for every player movement

- Physics:
	- Using real physics for jump (with constant downwards acceleration)
	- Collision detection in both axis
	- Only test for collision while platforms are in view

- Drawing:
	- Only draws platforms while they are in view

- Debug:
	- Using sf:Text to display useful variables while in debug to make runtime
debugging possible (breakpoints can be a hassle with fast-paced games)
